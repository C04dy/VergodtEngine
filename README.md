2D game engine with Box2D physics and i use SDL for creating window and sprite rendering and stuff 

i want to add lua scripting and maybe steam audio and OpenGL renderer that im gonna write? but im not sure about that gonna add a fancy gui and stuff

this is fun

if you wanna use this make sure you have sdl2 sdl image and box2d libraries maybe when i start to learn how to make makefiles properly i would add those libs staticly linked
