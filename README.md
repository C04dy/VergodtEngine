# HOW TO USE

Engine is still in development. I dont recommend anyone to make games with it but there is nothing stopping you to make games with this engine.  
If you want to contribute to the development, clone this repository with the libraries included with '--recursive' flag. And then use the Cmake to configure build files. I use MinGW to develop the engine so i dont recommend using Visual Studio, but i highly recommend you to use Visual Studio Code with CmakeTools.
