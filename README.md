2D game engine with Box2D physics and i use SDL for window managment and sprite rendering and stuff 

i want to add lua scripting and maybe steam audio and OpenGL renderer that im gonna write? but im not sure

the GUI thing was when i first started the project and it has some old and questionable stuff that i think im
not gonna use in the end but i want to make a GUI for the game engine for easier development for people that
dont gonna actually use this engine but i think its gonna be fuuunnn to make yes this is not a bad idea

still in development idk if im gonna like add stuff in short time but idk it gonna be fun
