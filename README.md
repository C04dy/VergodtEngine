2D game engine with Box2D physics and i use SDL for creating window and sprite rendering and stuff

i want to add lua scripting and maybe steam audio and OpenGL renderer that im gonna write? but im not sure about that gonna add a fancy gui and stuff

if you want to use the engine first you need to build the libraries with Buildlibs.bat if you use windows "you need to run as and admin" or Buildlibs.sh if you use linux
