# HOW TO USE

Engine is still in development. I dont recommend anyone to make games with it but there is nothing stopping you to make games with this engine.  
If you want to contribute to the development, clone repo with the libraries included with '--recursive' and run 'BuildLibs' (if you use windows run it as admin) file to build the libraries. And then use the Cmake file to build the engine. I use MinGW to develop the engine so i dont recommend using Visual Studio, but i highly recommend you to use Visual Studio Code with CmakeTools. I develop the engine with Visual Studio Code. Run the workspace file to open the whole project.
